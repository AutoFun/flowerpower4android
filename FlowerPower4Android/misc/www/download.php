			<h2>Download</h2>
			This site does not currently host a ready-to-use library. But we're working on that.
			Up to now, please use the official <i>Flower Power for Android</i> Github page at

			<h2>Release Notes</h2>
			The first public release is a beta release and will contain bugs. You use it at your own risk.
			<p>
			It is currently not really a library. It ships as an example application which you can use as a basis for your own apps.
			BUT, with ongoing development, the API will surely be changed when adding new features or refactoring old ones. Please keep that in mind.
			<p>
			We currently havn't decided about a licence under which this library will be released, but it will probably be GPL or Apache.
